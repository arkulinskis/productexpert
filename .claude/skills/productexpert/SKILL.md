# Product Expert: working on the app

**What it is:** free training + certification that gets product managers ready to be a Director of Product. The user's
brief (2026-11-08): "deep research", "senior focused, not just what is scrum: all basics should fit neatly into a module,
the rest as advanced as you can get it". So Foundations module 1 (`core-toolkit`) holds every basic with the senior
critique; the other 31 modules are director-level. Core loop per module: read a sourced briefing -> drill (recall cards +
"Director's call?" judgements, Leitner boxes) -> leadership challenge with a rubric -> module complete; a program's final
exam issues a `PXP-...` certificate; Foundations + 4 specialist certificates = Director of Product (track id "fellow",
code DIR). Around it: 5 in-browser labs, the Library (~100 resources), 22 case files, week-by-week study plans. The
engine was ported from AI Expert (aiexpert, itself from C-Suite Coach); content, look, hero, labs, cases and Library are new.

**Where it lives:**
- Folder `C:\Users\arkvi\Documents\CLAUDE\productexpert\` = the git clone of **github.com/arkulinskis/productexpert**,
  branch `master`. "git" layout: the folder *is* the Anvil app. Anvil pulls master; pushing is the deploy. Live: not yet.
- Made from `C:\Users\arkvi\Documents\CLAUDE\APP_MAKER\template-forms` (native Anvil Forms, Nov 2026). Anvil's own agent
  skills describe the same model: `client-forms`, `data-models`, `server-code`, `client-modules`, `anvil-yaml`
  (github.com/anvil-works/anvil-agent-references; see APP_MAKER/ANVIL_NOTES.md, "Native Anvil Forms").
- **README.md** lists every feature. Keep it up to date.

**What the user wants:** "Strategy Memo" (chosen 2026-11-08): calm, senior, editorial, like a board memo. Cool paper
#F4F5F7, ink #171B24, deep cobalt #2340A8 (actions/progress), saffron #D9822B (bets, risk, gates: the one accent; as
text use --c-accent-text #96500D); dark #0F1219 with cobalt #8FA6FF and saffron #F0A75A. Newsreader (serif) headings,
Onest body, JetBrains Mono only for codes and numbers. 8px radius, hairlines, soft offset shadows, thin-line diagrams
(PX.fig) instead of photos. The landing's one authored moment is the feature-roadmap vs outcome-tree before/after board
(Components/BetBoard, PX.betboard). Loader preset "page". Free for now. Facts must be source-checked (same rule as
Marguru and AI Expert). Claude assumes details and builds; Claude deploys. Mobile-first (390 px). Light and dark.

## Workflow for any change

1. `git pull --ff-only` (Anvil commits "Edited ..." when the user changes something in the IDE; read those commits).
2. Edit: a page's template and Python side by side (`client_code/Pages/X/form_template.html` + `__init__.py`).
3. `python tools/check.py` (no -I) -> **ALL CHECKS PASSED**: Anvil's validator (`anvil validate`, type-checks every
   template and Python file against Anvil's API), JS syntax, asset hashes (`tools/assets.py`), server tests.
   Needs the Anvil CLI once: `npm install -g @anvil-works/anvil-cli`.
4. `python -I tools/ui_test.py` (Docker Desktop running) -> **ALL UI TESTS PASSED**: the folder runs as-is in the
   open-source Anvil App Server (container `productexpert-dev`) and headless Chrome walks tools/ui/flow.js, phone.js
   (true 390 px, no sideways scroll), admin.js and a11y.js (axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA on every page, light + dark, plus
   keyboard checks). Client edits show on reload; server edits need `--restart`. `--only a11y.js` runs one script.
   `--shots DIR` = screenshots of every page, desktop + phone, light + dark, guest + member: Read them.
5. Commit only your files as arkulinskis with the Co-Authored-By line; `git push origin master`.
   New tables/columns: tell the user to accept the **Schema Mismatch** alert ("The schema of the source code is correct").

## How things are done here

- **Page** = `client_code/Pages/X/` with `<anvil-form layout="Product_Expert.Layouts.Shell"><anvil-block slot="content">`
  and `class X(XTemplate)` taking `args=()` (the URL parts after `#x/`). Register it in router.py: `PAGES`, `_form`,
  and `NAV` if it belongs in the menu (max 4). Add its address to tools/ui/phone.js and its journey to flow.js.
- **The layout is reused between pages** (open_form keeps the Shell when the layout matches): anything in the Shell
  that depends on the user or the page goes in `Shell.refresh(page)`.
- **Navigation** = plain `<a href="#page">`; in code `router.go("page", arg)`; build links with `router.href`.
- **Static copy** = plain HTML in the template. **Text that changes** = a `Label` (role for the look).
- **Actions** = Anvil `Button` + `@handle("name", "click")`, roles `["btn", "btn-primary", "ic-plus"]`. Button roles
  are aliases of `.ui-btn` in app.css: `btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, `btn-danger` + `btn-solid`, `btn-sm`, `btn-lg`,
  `btn-icon`, `btn-block`. Icons: role `ic-<name>` on Buttons/Links, `<i class="ic ic-<name>">` in HTML
  (names in app-kit.js `UI.ICONS`; add one there and run tools/build_icons.py).
- **Inputs** = TextBox / TextArea / DropDown / CheckBox (styled by app.css through `.ui input`, `.ui textarea`).
  Read `.text` / `.selected_value` / `.checked`; `pressed_enter` for Enter.
- **Plain HTML that changes** = `anvil:name="x"`, then `self.x.visible`, `self.x.classes["on"] = ...`,
  `self.x.style[...]`; attributes with `state.set_attr(self.x, "href", ...)`. Native clicks:
  `anvil:on-dom:click="self.x_click"` + `def x_click(self, event)`.
- **Lists** = `RepeatingPanel` + an `Items/` Form; never build repeated HTML strings. Bind fields in the item template
  (`bind:text="self.item['title']"`). Grid/flex CSS goes on the panel's items container: `.anvil-role-<role> > div`.
  Item -> page: `self.parent.raise_event("x-something", ...)` + `panel.add_event_handler("x-something", ...)`.
  Role `contents` lets a panel's items join the surrounding grid.
- **Dialogs** = a Form in `Dialogs/`, `alert(Form(...), buttons=[], role="app-dialog")`; it closes itself with
  `self.raise_event("x-close-alert", value=...)`. Yes/no: `confirm(text, title=..., buttons=[("Cancel", False), ("Delete", True)])`.
- **Toasts** = `state.toast(msg, "ok" | "error")` (Anvil Notification with roles).
- **Server calls** = `state.call("fn", ...)` for normal flows (expected `{"ok": False, "error"}` -> toast, returns None);
  a page that shows a friendly state instead (not found, private) calls `anvil.server.call` and checks `ok` itself.
  Server functions: `@anvil.server.callable(require_user=True)`, `C.require_user()` / `C.require_admin()`, ownership
  checks, return plain dicts (`C.ok(...)` / `C.fail("...")`), never other people's emails. Tables are `client: none`.
- **JavaScript** only for engines Python is too slow for (canvas, SVG drawing, WebGL, audio, maps, PDF): put it in
  `theme/assets/<name>.js`, load it in head_html (then `python tools/assets.py`), wrap it in one Python module
  (`from anvil.js import window`) and/or a `Components/` custom component. Little Hero Books is the worked example.

- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA, the legal bar; 2026-11-04)**: tools/ui/a11y.js runs axe-core on every page (light +
  dark, guest + member) and fails on serious problems; add new pages to its PUBLIC/MEMBER lists. The rules:
  - Text colours reach 4.5:1 on every surface: check new tokens (`--c-faint`, `--c-accent` used as text, status
    colours on their `-soft` fills). Text on good/bad/warn fills is `var(--c-on-status)` (white light, ink dark).
  - Every field has a name: wrap it in `<label class="ui-field"><span>Caption</span>...</label>`, or
    `state.set_control_attr(box, "aria-label", "...")` when the caption isn't a label (set it AFTER `.items` on a
    DropDown: Anvil rebuilds the select). Name/email/phone/password get `autocomplete` (set_control_attr).
  - The page's title Label is a heading: `state.heading(label, 1)` (one per page; Labels render as divs).
  - Toggle buttons say they're on: `.ui-seg` buttons get aria-pressed from the "on" class automatically (app-kit.js);
    elsewhere `state.set_control_attr(btn, "aria-pressed", ...)`. Never `role="tablist"` without real tabs.
  - Messages that appear are read out: roles msg-error/msg-note get role alert/status automatically; other changing
    Labels: `state.live(label)`. Hidden text just for screen readers: Label role `sr`.
  - When a click redraws a RepeatingPanel, keep the keyboard's place: give the item's button a `data-key` and call
    `state.refocus(panel, key)` after the event (PlanPlate's Items/Chip). Buttons have no `.focus()`: `state.focus(btn)`.
  - Images: content images get real alt text (photos: their caption); decorative ones `alt=""`; a Button icon image
    is set to alt="" automatically. Hidden anti-spam fields: `tabindex=-1`, `autocomplete=off`.

- **Design kit (2026-11-05)**: `APP_MAKER/design/README.md` is the bar for every visual change (craft floor, the
  "AI-made" tells, motion rules, worst-case data). app.css carries its CSS between `design-kit:start/end` (easing and
  duration tokens, browser surfaces, text wrapping, press feedback, gentle reduced motion): every transition uses
  `--ease-*` / `--dur-*`, no `ease-in`, no `transition: all`, no eyebrow labels, no gradient text. Checks:
  `python -I APP_MAKER/tools/design_check.py productexpert` (source; check.py prints its summary) and tools/ui/design.js
  (rendered, desktop + phone, inside ui_test.py; add new pages to its PUBLIC/MEMBER). Deliberate exceptions:
  `design-ok: <rule>` comment on the line.

## App recipes

- **Content** lives in server_code/content_*.py (one file per program; content_core.py = track id "core", the others
  export PACK). Module shape: id, title, minutes, fig, lab (optional), summary, briefing[], do[], dont[], cases[],
  cards[(q, a, note)] (6), calls[(statement, is_director, why)] (exactly 3; True = a director would do this),
  challenge{id, title, fig, situation, ask, model, rubric[5]}, sources[]. Program ids: core, str, dsc, grw, biz, org,
  inf, frn. test_server.py checks counts (32 modules x 9 items, 40 challenges), case ids, lab ids and sources.
- **Senior bar**: basics belong only in `core-toolkit`. New modules must be director-level: portfolio, org, money,
  evidence, influence. Challenges use concrete numbers and a model answer a VP would sign.
- **Case files**: content_cases.py (role = leadership area tag; tone exemplary/cautionary/mixed). Keep claims modest and
  sourced; say "reported" where sources differ.
- **Library**: content_library.py tuples (id, title, by, kind, cost, url, tracks incl. "start", why). Link originals only.
- **Labs**: Labs.LABS (server list) + theme/assets/px-labs.js (`PX.lab(el, id, onDone)`); pure maths in `PX.labTest`
  (test in Node: `global.window={}; require('./theme/assets/px-labs.js')`). Peek: ~23% false winners when peeking vs
  ~5% fixed. Tree: target 8,000 with 8 points. Cohort: beat the founder plan (6% paid growth) with paid <= 2% and QR >= 1.3.
  Price: range ~$7-21. Unit: base LTV:CAC 2.86, payback 12.0. A new lab: add both, a module `lab` field, the name in
  Pages/Module (lab_text), flow/a11y/design/phone entries and the --shots list.
- **Diagrams**: `PX.fig(name)` specs in px-kit.js FIGS (nodes on a 400x225 grid, kinds b/a/g); every module/challenge
  `fig` must exist there. TRACK_FIG in client_code/px.py maps programs to diagrams.
- **Plans**: Plan.py (ORDER per goal, WARMUP per background, MODULE_EXTRA minutes); stored on users.plan.
- **Director rule**: Curriculum.FELLOW_NEED (4) + Exams.maybe_fellow. Ranks: Learning.RANKS (Associate PM -> VP of Product).
- **Feedback**: Prepsto link not created yet (claude@claude.com hit Prepsto's 60-link cap on 2026-11-08):
  `__PREPSTO_CODE__` remains in anvil.yaml, state.py, Shell and Library, so check.py reports it until replaced.

## Recipes

- **New table or column:** `db_schema` in anvil.yaml (same shape as the existing tables, `client: none`), then add it
  to server tests. Deploy, then the Schema Mismatch step. Personal data -> the legal kit (below).
- **New server function:** in a server module + tests in tools/testing/test_server.py (happy path, bad input,
  someone not allowed; public ones in `PUBLIC`).
- **Demo content:** DemoData.py (`is_demo=True`, `DEMO_TABLES`, children first).
- **Restyle:** tokens at the top of app.css (light and dark blocks), fonts in head_html, the spinner in theme.css
  (`python -I APP_MAKER/tools/loaders.py apply productexpert <preset>`), `LEGAL_THEME` in startup.py.
- **Icon:** edit theme/assets/icon.svg, `python -I tools/make_icons.py`, then `python tools/assets.py`.

## Gotchas

- The local App Server (1.18) lags hosted Anvil: no `HtmlComponent.attrs` (use state.set_attr), `Notification(role=)`
  raises (state.toast falls back), notifications are `.anvil-alert[data-notify]`, components are wrapped in
  `<anvil-dropzone>` (app.css: `display: contents`). app.css styles both. Test on hosted Anvil too for big changes.
- Anvil's alert() without `large=True` is a 300 px modal: our role `app-dialog` widens it.
- Headless Chrome: Anvil's service worker breaks reused profiles (drive.mjs bypasses it); phone width needs device
  emulation (`MOBILE=390,844`), windows can't go below ~500 px.
- `require_secure_passwords` rejects leaked passwords: tests use random ones.
- Heredocs in the Bash tool mangle quotes: write files with the Write tool.
- A script's `el.focus()` doesn't always match `:focus-visible`, so tests check focus rings through the CSS rules,
  not computed styles. Never put `outline: none` on `input:focus` without `:not([type=checkbox]):not([type=radio])`.
- Never write Anvil's theme-colour token pattern (percent, `color:`, name, percent) in theme.css.

## Privacy & Terms (legal kit)

From `C:/Users/arkvi/Documents/CLAUDE/APP_MAKER/legal-kit`: change `apps/productexpert.json`, then there
`python -I build.py productexpert && python -I install.py productexpert` (writes theme/assets/legal-kit.js,
client_code/legal.py, server_code/legal_server.py and the head_html tag), then `python tools/assets.py` and deploy.
Sign-up keeps the tick box (`legal.consent_field()` in Pages/Auth). Feedback = Prepsto only ("Submit feedback").
- Client and server modules share ONE Python package: a server module can't have the same name as a client
  package or module (server `Items.py` + client `Items/` = "Cannot resolve imported module"). The template's example
  server module is `ExampleItems.py` for that reason.
